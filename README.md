# Unsupervised ML - Creating Playlists with KMeans

This project was desgined to answer the following questions:

* Are Spotify’s audio features able to identify “similar songs”, as defined by humanly detectable criteria? When you listen to two rock ballads, two operas or two drum & bass songs, you identify them as similar songs. Are these similarities detectable using the audio features from Spotify?
* Is K-Means a good method to create playlists? Would you stick with this algorithm moving forward, or explore other methods to create playlists?
