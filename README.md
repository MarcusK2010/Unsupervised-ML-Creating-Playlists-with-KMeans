# Unsupervised ML - Creating Playlists with KMeans

This project was desgined to answer the following questions:

* Are Spotify’s audio features able to identify “similar songs”, as defined by humanly detectable criteria? When you listen to two rock ballads, two operas or two drum & bass songs, you identify them as similar songs. Are these similarities detectable using the audio features from Spotify?
* Is K-Means a good method to create playlists? Would you stick with this algorithm moving forward, or explore other methods to create playlists?

To anwers these question we were provided with three datasets (in `/Data`):

* `audio_features_10_songs.zip`, a 10 song playlist to get used to the basics (scalers, distances, clustering) 
* `audio_features_1000_songs.zip`, a 1000 song list to expertiment with different visualisations, scalers, or other clustering methods
* `audio_features_5000_songs.zip`, the actual set of 5000 songs to be clustered into playlists

The notebooks are to be found in `/Notebooks`:

`project_6_moosic_clustering.ipynb` is the one to play around with the 10 and 1000 song datasets.
`project_6_moosic_experimental_stage.ipynb` is the one to try different things out on the 5000 song dataset.
`project_6_moosic_consolidated.ipynb` is the one holding all the code for the propject

The final conclusion and the presentation can be found in `/Presentation`.
